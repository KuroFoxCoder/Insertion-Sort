# Challenges
I remember previously struggling with sorting in my past endeavors. I used a sorting method once that was known as the "Stupid sort", which while it worked, it was an inefficient sorting method. But it was through examination of the example in the lecture that I realized it, it was like taking things out and sorting them out by pushing them into new spots until it's sorted in whatever order you code it in. It's the closest way, in fact, that relates to how I sort things, if I have to do it. I do like ascending order.
